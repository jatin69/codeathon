```
Mr. Zazoo Zizoo has just finished giving his 10th board exams. He has a month vacation now. Zazoo is feeling bored and so decides to play a game with his girlfriend, Zuzoo. He tells Zuzoo that if she wins the game, he will take her on a coffee date. For this, Zazoo gives Zuzoo a huge game board that has holes on it and some 	tetris-like shapes. These tetris-like shapes are not restricted in terms of quantity i.e there is unlimited source of these shapes. Now, Zuzoo has to place these tetris-like shapes on the board and cover the board as exactly as possible. The source is capable of generating the following pieces:
```
1)
%%%
.%%
```
```
2)
%%.
%%%
```
```
3)
%.%
%%%
```
```
4)
..%
%%%
%..
```
```
5)
.%.
%%%
.%.
```

Zazoo tells Zuzoo that she is allowed to flip and rotate pieces before placing them on the board.

Input

The first line contains two numbers - 100<=n,m<=100 - the height and the width of the board. The next n lines, each containing m space-separated numbers, are the board description. The symbol '0' is a square which should be filled, the symbol '1' is a square which should not be filled.

```
Constraints:
3<=n<=100
3<=m<=100
```

Output

First output the number of pieces used, k < 106. Then write k successive descriptions of the used pieces. Each description should be of the form: t - the number of full squares of the piece, followed by t pairs of integers denoting the coordinates of the respective squares (using 0-based offsets, with the top-left of input written as (0,0) ).
